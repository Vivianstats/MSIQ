Description: MSIQ is developed for more accurate and robust isoform quantification, by integrating multiple RNA-seq samples under a Bayesian framework. Our method aims to (1) identify the consistent group of samples with homogeneous quality and (2) improve isoform quantification accuracy by jointly modeling multiple RNA-seq samples with more weights on the consistent group.
